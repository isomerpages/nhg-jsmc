<h1><strong>Oasia Hotel Novena</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<h4>Nothing beats seeing and experiencing Oasia with a well-deserved relaxing stay in our exquisite rooms.</h4>

<p>Wood, granite and other natural elements make up the calming landscape
in the charming enclave of Oasia Hotel Novena, located near the bustling
Orchard Road and business district. While soothing tones fill the hotel,
the epitome of comfort and style is best enjoyed via the Club experience
designed by the acclaimed Takashi Sugimoto of interior design firm, Super
Potato.</p>
<p>Inspired by the natural environments of Asia, and the hospitality of our
cultures, thoughtful touches can be seen all over the hotel – from relaxing
oak and teak tones harmonised by natural light in the rooms to Oasia’s
signature scent in various spaces to refresh your senses. With Oasia’s
highly lauded award-winning Club Lounge and private pool, peace and quiet
comes with absolute exclusivity.</p>

through an air-conditioned, sheltered basement walkway. Singapore’s vibrant
lifestyle and premium shopping belt, Orchard Road, is only 2 stops away
from the Novena MRT station.</p>
