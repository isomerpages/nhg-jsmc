<h3>Digitally Enabled Workforce</h3>
<p>The digital age is transforming nursing, integrating technology into patient
care, education, and administration. Electronic health records (EHRs),
telehealth, and mobile health apps enhance efficiency, accessibility, and

analytics assist in clinical decision-making, improving outcomes. Digital
platforms enable remote monitoring, reducing hospital visits and empowering
patients in self-care. Nurses leverage e-learning and virtual simulations
for skill development and staying updated on best practices. However, challenges
like maintaining data security, addressing the digital divide, and managing
technology-related stress remain. Embracing the digital age fosters innovation
and elevates the nursing profession to meet evolving healthcare needs.</p>
