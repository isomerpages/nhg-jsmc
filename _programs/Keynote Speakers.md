<h3>Ms Pauline Tan</h3>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Ms Pauline Tan is the Chief Nurse of The National Kidney Foundation (NKF).
Known for her humility and nurturing leadership, Pauline leads her team
of over 1200 nurses to deliver empathetic, compassionate and exceptional
service to more than 5,400 dialysis patients across 45 dialysis centres
in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With 36 years of nursing experience in Singapore and Canada, Pauline has
since made great strides in transforming community dialysis care. She established
training programmes aimed to develop promising nursing leaders, while focusing
on enhancing the skills sets of all nurses to ensure highest possible standards
of personalised patient care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under her exemplary leadership, NKF introduced a holistic renal rehabilitation
programme, empowering dialysis patients to have better quality of life.
With patients’ safety, comfort and treatment outcomes in mind, Pauline
implemented innovative treatment solutions, including nocturnal dialysis,
plastic cannulas for overnight dialysis, and ultrasound technology to improve
cannulation. Through collaborative efforts in training nurses to resolve
blocked catheters, the resulting streamlined and efficient process benefitted
patients in time and cost, while freeing up hospital beds for more critical
needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pauline’s unwavering commitment to living out NKF’s care philosophy earned
her the most prestigious accolade – the President’s Award for Nurses in
2023 – and multiple awards for the Foundation. Her vision is for all nurses
to be strong patient advocates to uphold their rights and interests, while
delivering high quality care. Her relentless approach towards person-centered
care echoes NKF’s resolute mission of Giving Life and Hope to every patient
and their loved ones.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Across Malaysia and Singapore, nurses stand at the heart of healthcare
delivery—especially as populations age and the burden of chronic diseases
continues to grow. As the largest group of healthcare professionals, nurses
are not only caregivers at the bedside but also leaders who shape patient
outcomes, influence policy, and transform systems of care.</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This keynote draws on Pauline Tan’s unique journey as a nurse leader in
both Canada and Singapore. During her time as a clinician at Foothills
Medical Centre in Calgary, she saw first-hand how multidisciplinary collaboration,
evidence-based practice, and patient-centred models of care could significantly
improve outcomes for patients with complex chronic illnesses. These Canadian
experiences highlighted the need to empower nurses not just as skilled
caregivers, but also as active partners in clinical decision-making and
system design.</p>
<p>Building on that foundation, Pauline’s leadership at the National Kidney
Foundation Singapore over the past eight years has focused on elevating
dialysis care standards to extend the lives of patients with kidney failure.
Through structured training frameworks, embedded mentorship, and a culture
of accountability and compassion, her team has achieved measurable improvements
in survival rates, reduced hospitalisations, and enhanced quality of life.
In recognition of these contributions, Pauline received the President’s
Nurse Award 2023—Singapore’s highest honour for nursing excellence.</p>
<p>With over three decades of experience in nursing—and eight years leading
a national dialysis nursing team—Pauline will share how high standards
of practice, strong mentorship, and resilient teams can drive tangible
improvements in care outcomes.</p>
<p>The keynote will also explore the leadership capabilities needed to sustain
this transformation:</p>
<p>· Developing robust succession planning to prepare nurses for advanced
practice, leadership, and management roles.</p>
<p>· Building emotional resilience and intelligence in nurse leaders to navigate
increasing system pressures.</p>
<p>· Fostering a culture of mentorship, recognition, and professional growth
to retain talent and reduce burnout.</p>
<p>· Preparing nurse leaders to engage with technology, health economics,
and policymaking.</p>
<p>Participants will gain insights into how nurses can embrace technological
change, lead digital health initiatives, and balance efficiency with compassion
in high-pressure environments. Emphasis will also be placed on the importance
of regional collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore—to share best
practices, harmonise training, and collectively shape the next generation
of nursing leaders.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this keynote is a call to action: for nurses to see themselves
not only as caregivers, but as change-makers who hold the key to advancing
healthcare in ASEAN. By extending lives, empowering nurses, and transforming
healthcare—we can build a future where patients live not just longer, but
better.</p>
