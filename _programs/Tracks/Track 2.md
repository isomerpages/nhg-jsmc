<summary>Track 2D - From Caregivers to Change Agents: The New Nursing Paradigm</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, nursing is undergoing
a remarkable transformation that extends far beyond traditional bedside
care. This new nursing paradigm reimagines nurses as powerful change agents
who not only provide essential care but also drive innovation in healthcare
delivery. By embracing concepts like "cleaning to care" and fostering collaboration
between professional caregivers and domestic helpers, this approach creates
a more integrated and effective care environment. Perhaps most significantly,
it recognizes patients as active participants in their own health journeys,
exemplified by innovative initiatives where patients become community contributors,
such as serving as baristas while promoting wellness. This shift represents
a fundamental change in how we view healthcare delivery, creating a more
dynamic and inclusive system that benefits all stakeholders.</p>
