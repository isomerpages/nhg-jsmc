<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This session traces the evolution of care approach from integrated care
to place-based and relationship-based models. It begins with system-level
integration aimed at reducing care fragmentation across institutions, then
shifts toward localizing services through place-based strategies anchored
in community needs. The journey culminates in a deeper focus on relationship-based
care, where trust, continuity, and human connection become central to care
delivery. Together, these phases reflect a progressive move toward people-
and community-centred care that is both coordinated and compassionate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Breaking Silos - Encouraging Cross-Setting Collaboration in Palliative
Care" explores the common challenges of working across hospital wards,
nursing homes, and community care teams. We'll look at familiar scenarios
like "that's not how we do it here" and "our systems are different," examining
why these barriers develop and how they affect patient care.</p>
<p>Moving beyond challenges, we'll explore successful examples where healthcare
teams have effectively bridged these gaps. Through practical case studies,
we'll see how different settings have created better ways to work together,
leading to improved care coordination and more satisfying work environments
for healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The final part focuses on practical steps that nurses can implement in
their daily practice to enhance collaboration across settings. We'll share
straightforward, tested approaches that have helped teams work more effectively
together, because good palliative care relies on smooth coordination between
all care providers.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Jessie is an Advanced Practice Nurse with a deep interest in geriatric
medicine, particularly dementia and incontinence as well as caregiving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her foray into cognition and memory work began in 2011 with the Memory
Team, where she was nurse manager of the first integrated care initiative
for dementia in Singapore, CARITAS icommunity@north. This programme provided
leadership, training and support to over 10 community and primary care
partners, enabling them to care for patients with dementia and their families
as a vertically integrated practice unit. Concurrently, she saw to the
inception of the first restraint-free ward adopting person centred care
(PCC) for patients with delirium and dementia in KTPH.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ward celebrated 10 years of restraint- free care in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising the growing need, Jessie and the team helped spread PCC principles
hospital-wide through staff training and a roving team known as the 6<sup>th</sup> Vital
Sign Team. They adopt the “4 Ms “framework from the US Institute for Healthcare
Improvement (IHI) Age-Friendly Hospital initiative and Humanitude care
methodology to deliver PCC that promotes the physical and psychological
well-being of these patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jessie is currently an L3-level Humanitude trainer, enhancing her skills
and knowledge in caring for the vulnerable patients. &nbsp;</p>

<summary>Track 1B1: Compassion Without Borders: The Universal Language of Care
- Humanitude In Dementia Care</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This talk explores Humanitude, a caregiving approach emphasizing empathy,
respect, and emotional connection that was developed by Yves Gineste and
Rosette Marescotti in 1979. Humanitude has since been adopted globally.
Notably, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital is the first acute hospital locally to
implement Humanitude, showcasing its potential in acute care settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In dementia care, Humanitude provides a universal language of care that:&nbsp;
<br>1. Prioritizes emotional connection: Building relationships and validating
patients' emotions.&nbsp;
<br>2. Fosters person-centered care: Tailoring care to individual needs and
preferences.&nbsp;
<br>3. Promotes dignity and respect: Gentle, compassionate interactions enhancing
patients' well-being.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four pillars of Humanitude— Gaze, Speech, Touch, and Verticality—are
central to this approach. A simple structured approach known as the sensory
capture would also be introduced to guide the care of patients with dementia
to provide respectful, compassionate care, grounded in the four pillars
of Humanitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>By understanding and applying Humanitude principles, caregivers can deliver
high-quality, compassionate care to vulnerable patients living with dementia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>wee Hia has been pivotal in growing SingHealth’s nursing capacity and
expertise over the years. She was key in developing the SingHealth Alice
Lee Institute of Advanced Nursing (IAN), which has been the principal node

training for nurses and healthcare support staff. In 2007, she led IAN
to achieve the distinction of being accredited by the American Nurses Credentialing
Centre (ANCC) as a Continuing Nursing Education Provider, the first in
Asia and third outside the United States to achieve this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

first Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation in 2005 – the
largest teaching hospital in Asia to be accorded such recognition at that
time. In 2010, she led SGH to become the first Magnet hospital in Singapore
and South-East Asia, a testament to the hospital’s world-class quality
nursing care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a key member of the former Singapore Workforce Development Agency’s
Healthcare Industry Skills Training Council, Swee Hia was involved in the
set-up, review and expansion of the Healthcare Support WSQ framework. She
also spearheaded the Skills Training Employability Enhancement for Retrenched
and Unemployed Workers (STEER) and Return-To-Nursing (RTN) programmes for
Registered and Enrolled Nurses, as well as introduced the Principal Enrolled
Nurses into the Enrolled Nurses Career Development Plan and the Tan Chin
Tuan Nursing Award for Enrolled Nurses.&nbsp;&nbsp; During her tenure as
the President of the Singapore Nurses Association (SNA) from 2012 to 2020,
Swee Hia led the SNA to win the bid to host the International Council of
Nurses Congress for the first time in Singapore in 2019, which was attended
by more than 5,000 nursing leaders from 120 countries.</p>
