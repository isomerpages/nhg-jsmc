Palliative Care.</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Breaking Silos - Encouraging Cross-Setting Collaboration in Palliative
Care" explores the common challenges of working across hospital wards,
nursing homes, and community care teams. We'll look at familiar scenarios
like "that's not how we do it here" and "our systems are different," examining
why these barriers develop and how they affect patient care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving beyond challenges, we'll explore successful examples where healthcare
teams have effectively bridged these gaps. Through practical case studies,
we'll see how different settings have created better ways to work together,
leading to improved care coordination and more satisfying work environments
for healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final part focuses on practical steps that nurses can implement in
their daily practice to enhance collaboration across settings. We'll share
straightforward, tested approaches that have helped teams work more effectively
together, because good palliative care relies on smooth coordination between
all care providers.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Track 1A2: Journeying with Patients&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As Singapore's population ages rapidly, community nursing is becoming
increasingly critical in delivering holistic, person-centred care closer
to home. This approach explores how strengthening human connections and
partnerships can transform patient care journeys and elevate community
nursing practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The healthcare landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting
towards community-based care. This new model brings services closer to
where people live, moving away from traditional hospital-centric approaches.
Healthcare professionals, embracing active listening, empathy, and respect,
are better equipped to provide personalized care in community settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrated Care Networks support seamless transitions across care settings,
strengthening ties with community resources. This enables patients to access
coordinated services, improving health outcomes and fostering a resilient
integrated health ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaking down silos is crucial in overcoming institutional and professional
barriers that hinder collaboration. Leadership plays a pivotal role in
building inter-professional trust, driving social-health integration, and
implementing shared care plans and multidisciplinary case discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient empowerment is at the heart of this transformation. By engaging
patients and families as active partners in care, and exploring approaches
like structured health coaching, peer support programmes, and digital literacy
initiatives, self-management is enhanced, and supportive networks are built
to sustain long-term well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach enhances accessibility, promotes continuity of
care, and addresses individuals' holistic needs, including social and environmental
factors. It is particularly crucial for managing chronic conditions and
supporting Singapore's ageing population, enabling more proactive, preventive,
and patient-centred care. Ultimately, this model empowers patients, strengthens
community ties, and leads to improved health outcomes and a more sustainable
healthcare system.&nbsp;</p>
