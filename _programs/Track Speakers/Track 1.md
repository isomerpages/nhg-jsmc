<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Breaking Silos - Encouraging Cross-Setting Collaboration in Palliative
Care" explores the common challenges of working across hospital wards,
nursing homes, and community care teams. We'll look at familiar scenarios
like "that's not how we do it here" and "our systems are different," examining
why these barriers develop and how they affect patient care.</p>
<p>Moving beyond challenges, we'll explore successful examples where healthcare
teams have effectively bridged these gaps. Through practical case studies,
we'll see how different settings have created better ways to work together,
leading to improved care coordination and more satisfying work environments
for healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The final part focuses on practical steps that nurses can implement in
their daily practice to enhance collaboration across settings. We'll share
straightforward, tested approaches that have helped teams work more effectively
together, because good palliative care relies on smooth coordination between
all care providers.</p>
