</ol>
<p>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) provide distinct benefits
in education, patient empowerment, and long-term diabetes management. The
remote monitoring features of CGMS significantly improve clinician oversight,
establishing a foundation for a more agile, technology-driven approach
to diabetes care. When utilized effectively, CGMS can instill patients
with increased confidence and independence in managing their diabetes,
particularly for those with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I will share how one of my patients with Type 1 DM has benefited from
the subsidized CGMS for her diabetes self-management.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Inpatient CGMS use&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems provide real-time glucose data that
can improve inpatient diabetes management and minimize the need for fingerstick
testing. However, there are limitations include potential inaccuracies
in critically ill patients, device interference from radiology investigation
and certain medication&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other challenges include hospital IT compatibility, clear clinical protocols
and the need for staff training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, it is currently only used in select inpatient population. We
need more clinical supporting data and system support to enhance its use
in inpatient setting</p>

<summary>Track 3D1: Innovation for Smarter Patient Care</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Owing to the aging population and demanding lifestyle in Singapore, individuals
are increasingly vulnerable to coronary heart disease (CHD). Heart attack,
the most severe form of CHD, is a debilitating condition that significantly
impacts both physical health and psychological well-being. Mobile health
(mHealth), which leverages smartphones, internet connectivity, and communication
technologies, has gained popularity in the management of chronic diseases.
This study aimed to develop and evaluate an integrated, home-based mHealth
cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme—Integrative Cardiac Rehabilitation
Employing Smartphone Technology (i-CREST)—to support patients' recovery
following hospital discharge after a heart attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effectiveness of i-CREST was evaluated in terms of CR participation
(i.e., uptake, adherence, and completion), quality of life, symptoms of
anxiety and depression, cardiac self-efficacy, and cardiac risk factors,
and was compared with a traditional hospital-based CR programme (CBCR).
In collaboration with the cardiac rehabilitation team at the National University
Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS), we recruited 50 post-acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) patients. The i-CREST programme demonstrated a significantly
higher completion rate (84% vs. 40%; p = 0.001) and superior performance
in the 6-Minute Walk Test at 6 weeks (530.8 m vs. 480.2 m; p = 0.017) compared
to CBCR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the i-CREST programme,
although recruitment strategies require refinement. i-CREST shows promise
as an effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional CBCR.
A full-scale study is recommended to validate these findings.&nbsp;</p>
