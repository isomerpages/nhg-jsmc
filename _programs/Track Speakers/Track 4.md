<summary>Bridging Generations: The Novice, The Emerging &amp; The Veteran</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As healthcare systems evolve, the need for a well-prepared nursing workforce
becomes more urgent than ever. This session explores how structured onboarding
and residency training programs, developed through cross-national collaboration—particularly
between Thailand and Singapore—have transformed the way new nurses are
integrated into clinical practice. With education and leadership development
at the core, these initiatives address the critical transition from classroom
to clinical setting by bridging the gap between novice nurses and experienced
professionals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The presentation highlights Thailand’s national efforts to embed competency-based
education into onboarding systems, fostering not only clinical proficiency
but also leadership potential among emerging nurses. Through mentorship
models, intergenerational knowledge-sharing, and modern learning platforms,
new nurses gain the confidence and capability to thrive, while veteran
nurses are empowered to lead, coach, and adapt to change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session also outlines the policy-level impact of these innovations—illustrating
how pilot programs evolved into national frameworks that now guide the
professional development of thousands of nurses. Participants will gain
practical insights into implementing scalable, evidence-informed strategies
that enhance nurse retention, foster cross-generational collaboration,
and ensure long-term sustainability of the nursing workforce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether you are an educator, administrator, or policymaker, this session
offers a forward-thinking model of how international inspiration and local
innovation can be combined to strengthen nursing capacity, leadership,
and workforce resilience for the future.</p>

<summary>Track 4A2: <strong>: Investing in Tomorrow: Supporting The Next Generation of Nurses</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>With the changing healthcare landscape and on-going nursing manpower challenges,
it is time we need to focus on supporting and nurturing the next generation
of nurses towards building a stable, competent and sustainable workforce.
Two key areas to address:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing Multigenerational
Nursing Workforce</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investing in Nursing
now &amp; future</p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, our nursing workforce comprises of several generations of nurses.
It is important we need to reframe our perceptions on generational diversity
through different lens and try to view the different attitudes and behaviors
as potential strengths.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Integrating multiple generations of nurses requires understanding generational
differences such as work values, work styles, communication preferences
and motivational factors. Both recognizing and appreciating the different
generational perspectives can help build a more positive work environment
that enhances intergeneration harmony, mutual understanding, and teamwork.
Will explore the best practices and strategies to integrate multigenerational
nursing workforce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The past many years especially during and post pandemic period have highlighted
the critical necessity of nurses to healthcare, and the improvement of
patient experience and outcome starts with prioritizing nurses. With the
ageing population, the increasing complexity of healthcare needs and the
rise of chronic conditions, the demand of competent and skilled nurses
in a range of settings continues to grow (e.g., primary &amp; community
settings).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nurses being the largest professional group are indeed the backbone of
the healthcare system. It is so important to start investing in nursing
now and to recognize the importance of investing in the next generation
of nurses to be future ready to ensure a stable nursing workforce and sustainable
healthcare system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This involves supporting nurses through education and training, creating
supportive work environments, professional growth &amp; development and
fostering leadership development.</p>

<summary>Track 4C2: Prevent and Protect: Safeguarding Nurses from Workplace Abuse
and Violence</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In Singapore’s healthcare system, safeguarding nurses from workplace abuse
and violence is essential to ensuring both staff well-being and quality
patient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Prevent</strong> pillar focuses on proactive strategies, starting
with the enforcement of zero-tolerance policies against any form of abuse—verbal,
physical, or psychological. Nurses and other frontline staff should be
trained to recognize early signs of potential aggression and to apply effective
de-escalation techniques. This not only minimizes the risk of incidents
but also builds confidence in managing challenging situations.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The <strong>Protect</strong> pillar addresses the physical and procedural
safeguards needed to ensure nurse safety. Hospitals can incorporate infrastructure
enhancements such as strategically placed panic buttons, comprehensive
CCTV coverage, and secure ward layouts designed to reduce risk exposure.
Alongside these, confidential and non-punitive incident reporting channels
encourage nurses to speak up without fear of stigma or retaliation, enabling
timely interventions and organizational learning.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Finally, the <strong>Support </strong>pillar ensures that, should an incident
occur, affected staff receive prompt and comprehensive assistance. This
includes immediate medical attention, psychological counselling, and peer
support systems to aid recovery and restore workplace confidence. Transparent
investigation processes and clear follow-up actions further reassure staff
that their safety is a top priority.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Together, these three pillars—Prevent, Protect, and Support—form a holistic
framework that not only reduces the incidence of workplace violence but
also reinforces a culture of safety, respect, and trust within Singapore’s
hospitals. Such measures are crucial to sustaining a resilient healthcare
workforce capable of delivering high-quality care in a safe environment.</p>

<p>With over 15 years of nursing experience, I began my career at Tan Tock
Seng Hospital in 2009, starting as a ward nurse where I honed my clinical
skills and developed a deep understanding of patient care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My journey took an exciting turn when I contributed to a significant hospital-wide
initiative, implementing an early warning system that enhanced patient
safety. Passionate about nurturing the next generation of nurses, I transitioned
into education, where I spent several rewarding years mentoring and teaching
nursing students during their clinical attachments at TTSH.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While my students often joked about my 'tortuous' training methods, watching
them grow into confident healthcare professionals was immensely fulfilling.
After COVID, I took on a new challenge in developing the Nursing Practice
department, where I focused on standardising and elevating nursing practices
across TTSH's numerous wards, ensuring consistent, high-quality care delivery
throughout the hospital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though the journey in Nursing Practice has been challenging, the satisfaction
of seeing positive changes in nursing care makes every effort worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s dynamic healthcare environment, inclusivity is no longer an
option- it is the foundation that strengthens nursing practice and patient
care. An inclusive cultures value diversity, embraces that every nurse
feels respected, supported, and empowered. It fosters a sense of belonging
that not only enhances collaboration among teams but also drives innovation

<summary>Track 4E1: Embracing Flexibility: The Power of Liquid Nursing in Workforce
Scheduling</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This session delves into a groundbreaking workforce transformation initiative
that is reshaping nursing practice through the innovative Liquid Nursing
model. At its core, this discussion explores how traditional nursing constraints
are being dissolved through an adaptable framework built on three fundamental
pillars: role agility through modular nursing competencies, scheduling
autonomy aligned with personal priorities, and career advancement via competency-based
development. Through comprehensive time-motion studies, focus group discussions,
and strategic implementation across 55 inpatient wards encompassing 1,199
nurses, the initiative has demonstrated remarkable outcomes. &nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will showcase how the introduction of six flexible shift schedules
and modularized nursing roles, coupled with a modified ISoBAR framework
for handovers, has revolutionized workforce management. Staff surveys reveal
that 70% of nurses report enhanced schedule flexibility, with a notable
reduction in burnout levels compared to non-flexible wards. Key achievements
include an 83% reduction in roster planning time, improved call bell response
times within the 45-second target, and a significant decrease in hospital
attrition rates from 6.9% to 5.2% between 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants will gain insights into the implementation strategy, phased
across five stages, which focuses on matching staffing demand with supply
while maintaining strong teamwork principles. The discussion will highlight
how this Liquid Nursing concept not only addresses contemporary workforce
challenges but also demonstrates the powerful impact of strategic workforce
redesign on both patient care quality and staff satisfaction in modern
healthcare settings.&nbsp;</p>
