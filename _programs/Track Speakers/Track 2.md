<summary>Track 2A1: Vision for Future Nursing: Synergising Roles, Riding Waves,
Reaching Stars</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As healthcare evolves at an unprecedented pace, we stand at a pivotal
moment of reimagining nursing practice. This presentation explores how
the intentional integration of nursing roles - Educators, Administrators,
Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs), and Doctors of Nursing Practice (DNPs)
- creates a powerful collective force that propels us forward as we navigate
the waves of healthcare transformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's nursing landscape demonstrates the strength of synergistic leadership,
with each role illuminating pathways in our expanding healthcare universe.&nbsp;
We're witnessing Educators developing digital-age competencies, Administrators
driving innovative care models, APNs expanding clinical boundaries, and
DNPs translating research into transformative practice. These strategic
intersections between roles create new possibilities for healthcare excellence
and system-wide improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future holds even greater potential as we build bridges across nursing
domains, reaching for new heights of possibility. Through real-world examples
and evidence-based insights, this presentation will demonstrate how the
deliberate integration of clinical expertise, educational innovation, administrative
leadership, and research practice creates sustainable healthcare solutions.&nbsp;
We'll explore how this synergistic approach addresses complex healthcare
challenges while elevating patient care outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will examine how strategic collaboration and role integration are unleashing
nursing's full potential.&nbsp; Together, we'll ride the waves of change
while reaching for the stars, discovering how combining our unique strengths
and expertise can drive meaningful healthcare transformation. The future
of nursing lies not in individual excellence alone, but in our collective
ability to work together in powerful new ways.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>Deputy Director, Nursing Service, Tan Tock Seng Hospital</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>I joined nursing 40 years ago with considerable years in the critical
care of Neuroscience ICU, where the work demands are the highest compared
to other ICUs. Through the experiences, I gained a great deal of new skills
and knowledge with the guidance from my supervisors, and grow from strength
to strength to become a charge nurse, preceptor, mentor and eventually
becoming an administrator. Working in the busy Neuro care setting is challenging
as the environment can be intense. Nevertheless, the fast pace dynamic
environment and the invaluable work experiences have helped me developed
multiple skill sets in management, operations and strategic planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I transitioned from a nurse to administrator role since 2008 overseeing
nursing manpower and talent management portfolio. I lead Strategic Transformation
portfolio (2020 – 2024) and serve as the catalyst to provide leadership
in nursing research, education, and workforce transformation. I am responsible
for directing the development and alignment of nursing service teams to
achieve institution and NHG strategic objectives through capability building,
nursing centric workforce programs and organisational transformation. I
embarked on a new role in April 2025 i.e. People Experience portfolio that
provide strategic direction and drive the implementation of person – centric
programs and initiatives focusing on (i) elevating the patient and family’s
experience in their care journey and (ii) elevating staff experience focusing
on health &amp; well-being, workplace culture and civility.</p>

<summary>Track 2A2: Leadership in Nursing: Developing Managers and Policy Influencers</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The role of modern nursing leadership in the new millennium is dynamic
and multifaceted, shaped by rapid advancements in healthcare, technology,
and evolving patient needs. Modern nurse leaders are not just clinical
experts – they are strategic thinkers who help shape the future of healthcare
delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective leaders today must be clinically competent, tech-savvy, emotionally
intelligent, and politically astute. They are essential in shaping safe,
equitable and forward-looking healthcare systems. Leading in the new era
demands adaptive, informed and empowered nurse leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will focus on how nurses can grow as leaders, navigating change
and shaping institutional policy.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>Track 2B2: Love is in the air “twelve-kilometres high medicine"</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Flight nurses are a specialized group of professionals who care for acutely
ill patients outside the hospital environment. We are an essential part
of the medical team that transfers patients from hospitals to hospitals,
countries to countries, and even continents to continents. These are typically
critically ill patients, often attached to ventilators and requiring inotropes.
We take them from the ICU environment into an air ambulance and fly long
distances to destination hospitals.</p>
<p>To perform these demanding tasks, we must prepare all our equipment such
as ventilators, infusion pumps, and monitors which are specially designed
to be portable. During transfers, we must remain sharp in our observations
and judgments amid constant movements, vibrations, background noises, and
while</p>
<p>traversing different time zones. We work in a confined environment, often
with limited access to the patient.</p>
<p>Such an unusual working environment attracts only a small group of nurses.
It is this passion and the challenges I face, 12 km above ground level,
that makes my working career exciting.</p>
