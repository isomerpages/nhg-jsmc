<summary>Track 2A3: Meeting The Healthcare Needs (Sharing Of Initiatives Nurses
Embarked To Cope With Healthcare Challenges)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Healthcare today faces unprecedented demands - aging populations, complex
chronic diseases, staff shortages, and rapid technological change. Yet
nurses worldwide are responding with remarkable innovation and resilience.
One key initiative is integrated care networks, where nurses break down
institutional silos to coordinate seamless patient journeys. By leading
multidisciplinary teams, we ensure continuity from hospital to community
care, especially for vulnerable patients. Technology adoption has been
transformative. Smart wards and mobile health tools enhance efficiency
while preserving human connection. Nurses are the bridge - ensuring technology
serves patients rather than replacing compassionate care. We are also reimagining
workforce support systems. Mentorship programs nurture new nurses, while
shared governance models empower frontline voices. Psychological safety
initiatives help teams thrive in high-stress environments. Most crucially,
nurses are stepping up as leaders and advocates. From pandemic response
to policy reform, we're shaping healthcare systems to be more responsive
and equitable. These initiatives showcase nursing's unique dual role: expert
caregivers at the bedside and visionary changemakers at the system level.
By sharing these solutions, we can collectively build a more sustainable
future for healthcare.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>Track 2B1: Nursing with a Different ‘Hat’&nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In today’s healthcare landscape, many nurses feel confined by traditional
roles and limitations, with some even leaving the profession because they
see no path forward beyond the bedside. This presentation challenges that
perception by questioning whether these boundaries are truly real or simply
walls we have built around ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By reframing nursing through the lenses of nurses beyond boundaries, we
see how nurses can expand their impact from direct patient care to influencing
systems, shaping protocols and creating solutions that transform healthcare.
Stories of breaking boundaries illustrate the shift from caring for a few
to improving care for thousands, from following rules to designing them,
and from spotting problems to driving innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With technology amplifying the reach and influence of nurses, the ripple
effect of stepping beyond boundaries can inspire and empower others. The
message is clear: the future of healthcare depends on nurses who dare to
move beyond.&nbsp;Nursing with a Different ‘Hat’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flight nurses are a specialized group of professionals who care for acutely

We take them from the ICU environment into an air ambulance and fly long
distances to destination hospitals.</p>
<p>To perform these demanding tasks, we must prepare all our equipment such
as ventilators, infusion pumps, and monitors which are specially designed
to be portable. During transfers, we must remain sharp in our observations
and judgments amid constant movements, vibrations, background noises, and
while</p>
<p>traversing different time zones. We work in a confined environment, often
with limited access to the patient.</p>

<summary>Track 2D1: From Caregivers to Change Agents: The New Nursing Paradigm</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Caregivers are the backbone of patient recovery, yet many face overwhelming
physical, emotional, and financial challenges that compromise care quality
and increase hospital readmission risks. The CarerLink Programme was created
in response to these complex pressures, offering an organized, evidence-based
approach to identify, train, and support at-risk caregivers through their
care journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By enrolling high-risk caregiver-patient dyads, CarerLink provides a personalized
curriculum built around key care tasks and links families with community
resources for sustained support. The session will present data from 474
screened patients, with 78 caregiver-patient dyads enrolled, highlighting
significant improvements: 46% reported lower burden and 50% greater confidence.
Importantly, feedback also reveals the nuanced realities of caregiving,
as some participants experienced heightened awareness of challenges. Staff
perspectives underscore ongoing barriers to embedding CarerLink into clinical
workflows, pointing to the need for clearer processes and stronger staff
buy-in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite these integration challenges, CarerLink has proven valuable in
supporting caregiver mastery, building system-community linkages, and providing

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Nazrina Hoque is a healthcare professional whose career journey reflects
her commitment to public service and personal growth. After completing
her GCE A Levels, she served as a Prison Officer in the Singapore Prisons
Service for ten years. Seeking a new challenge, she transitioned into healthcare
through the Professional Conversion Programme, earning her Diploma in Nursing.
Her dedication to specialised care led her to pursue an Advanced Diploma
in Gerontology after two years of nursing practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently in her sixth year as a nurse, Nazrina brings valuable expertise
to elderly care. Her fluency in conversational Mandarin enhances her ability
to connect with patients in Singapore's multicultural healthcare setting.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>Track 2E2: Career Conversion Program, Why Change?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Nazrina Hoque's career journey reflects a profound evolution from law
enforcement to healthcare, driven by her growing desire to make a more
comprehensive impact on people's lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially attracted to the Singapore Prison Service for its benefits,
Nazrina soon discovered the limitations of her role as a Prison Officer.
Despite her desire to help inmates, she found herself constrained by legal
boundaries and the inability to provide support beyond prison walls. The
absence of inter-agency collaboration and personalised care led to professional
burnout after a decade of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The introduction to the Career Conversion Programme opened a new chapter
in her life through nursing. This transition revealed that nursing extended
far beyond basic patient care – it offered opportunities for holistic healthcare
delivery and patient advocacy. As a nurse, Nazrina found fulfilment in
being a patient's advocate, working to ensure they receive comprehensive
care and support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in her sixth year of nursing, with an Advanced Diploma in Gerontology,
she derives immense satisfaction from ensuring patients receive optimal
care, both during hospitalisation and post-discharge. Her bilingual abilities
in English and Mandarin further enhance her capacity to serve Singapore's
diverse patient population, making her healthcare journey both fulfilling
and purposeful.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>Track 2E3: Nursing Beyond Nurse: Non-nursing in a nursing environment</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Nursing involves a wide range of practice, going beyond the typical bedside
role. It comprises advanced practice jobs such as nurse practitioners,
midwives, and clinical nurse specialists, as well as administrative positions.
At the same non-nursing professionals such as healthcare professionals
such as doctors, pharmacists, physiotherapists, human resource staff, healthcare
assistants and IT staffs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These non-nursing professionals have grown increasingly important in nursing
settings in order to support the provision of comprehensive, secure and
effective care. With the advancement of technology, a sustainable and productive
nursing environment requires non-nursing positions. Electronic medical
records (EMR), for example, are created and maintained by IT staffs to
improve clinical documentation and lower the medical errors. Importantly,
recognizing the value of non-nursing roles fosters mutual respect and interprofessional
collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A collaborative environment allows the team to work collaboratively. Besides
it also enhances the patient safety by reducing the risks of medical error.
A more unified, responsive, and adaptable healthcare system is the outcome
of nurses and non-nurses working together to achieve common objectives,
such as safety, quality, and patient happiness. As a result, interdisciplinary
cooperation becomes essential to successful healthcare teams.&nbsp;</p>
