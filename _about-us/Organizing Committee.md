<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>My nursing career spans over 20 years, covering clinical practice, education,
and workforce development. My journey includes six years as a nursing lecturer
at a local polytechnic, where I had the privilege of guiding and mentoring
student nurses, as well as more than 10 years as a nurse educator in both
public and private healthcare institutions. Throughout my career, I have
been dedicated to equipping nurses—whether new graduates or experienced
practitioners—with the knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to provide
safe and compassionate care. I am passionate about fostering learning cultures,
enhancing clinical competence, and supporting professional growth to strengthen
nursing practice and improve patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
